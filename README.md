# Hacktoberfest2020
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
To participate, just register for the event and submit four qualifying pull requests to public GitHub repositories between now and October 31; the first 50,000 people who do both of those things will receive a free t-shirt. Like so many others, I'm more of a user than a contributor to open source
